            <p class="lead">bp’s internal IT service desk was under sustained pressure from a high volume of repetitive, low-complexity queries — think password resets, access requests, and basic “how-to” questions.</p>
          
            <p>Despite a mature ServiceNow platform and extensive knowledge base, employees struggled to find answers independently and defaulted to live support.</p>

          <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Key signals</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>~40% of service desk tickets were repeatable, low-complexity (L1 and below).</li>
              <li>42% of employees failed to resolve issues through existing self-serve channels.</li>
              <li>Live agent interactions cost <strong>~8x</strong> more than successful self-serve resolutions.</li>
              <li>78% of employees reported frustration with searching and filtering knowledge content.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This created a compounding problem:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Employees lost productivity waiting for support.</li>
              <li>Agents spent time on low-value work.</li>

            <h3>Strategic backdrop</h3>
            <p>This initiative sat within a broader “Shift Left” transformation roadmap — moving issue resolution as close to the employee as possible to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on L3 live support.</p>
            <p>Generative AI was identified as a potential enabler — not to replace agents, but to improve knowledge discovery, summarisation, and confidence in self-serve outcomes.</p>
